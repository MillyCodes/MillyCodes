### Hi there 👋

<!-- I'm Milly, a software engineer with experience in Ruby, Rails, JavaScript, React, MySQL and more.

I am enthusiastic about solving problems and outside of work my goal is to increase diversity in technology and help the next generation get their start. I am passionate about accessibility and committed to a web that works for everyone.-->
